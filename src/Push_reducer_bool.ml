  - The calls to `full` should be cheap as this function will be called to
    avoid allocation of unnecessary resources. If the computation required to decide if the reducer is full is expensive, consider caching it whenever possible.

  - If the producer's initialization is cheap, it should assume that reducer's
    initialization is expensive and, if possible, avoid calling init on the
    reducer.

  - If the producer's initialization is expensive, it should assume that
    reducer's initialization is cheap and, if possible, avoid it's own initialization.
